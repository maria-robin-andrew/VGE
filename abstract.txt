The usage of computers has been increased day to day, yet the physically disabled people find it near to impossible to use them. Controlling a mouse which is the simple GUI interaction can be tough job for the challenged persons. To solve this issue, we propose a virtual controlled mouse which can help them to fill the gap. For those who find difficulty in touchscreens and physical mouse inaccessiblity, this virtual mouse helps them to use mouse controls using eye gaze technique which makes mouse controls using eye movements. Eye gaze tracing an human eye for inputs. Eye movements are one of the most relaible ones for the physically disables people which we can make use of. Eye movement are regarded as a inputs in many software for tracking to analysis purposes. The eye gaze gets captured in real time frames from a web camera connected to the system without any other external hardware requirements. But using a human eye for long period of time cause eye fatigue, hence our system provides alerts for the excess usage of the virtual mouse.
