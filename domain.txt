Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. Deep learning has shown tremendous promise in the field of eye gaze analysis. With the development of powerful neural networks, it is now possible to accurately predict the gaze direction of a person based on their eye movements. This technology has a wide range of potential applications, from improving human-computer interaction to detecting early signs of neurological disorders. By analyzing large amounts of data and using complex algorithms, deep learning models can identify patterns and relationships in eye movement data that would be difficult or impossible for a human to detect. This has led to significant advancements in the field of eye gaze analysis and is likely to have a transformative impact on a wide range of industries in the coming years.
